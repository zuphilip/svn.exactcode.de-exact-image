 * We decided to map the library internals in an non-OO (Object
 * Oriented) way in order to archive the most flexible external
 * language choice possible and not to hold of refactoring from
 * time to time.
 *
 * (People demanding a detailed and Object Oriented interface
 *  can still choose to use the fine grained intern C++ API
 *  [which however is not set in stone {at least not yet}].)
